Real-time Stock Data
This API provides stock market data on a websocket stream. This helps receive the most up to date market information that could help your trading strategy to act upon certain market movements. If you wish to access the latest pricing data, using the stream provides much better accuracy and performance than polling the latest historical endpoints.

You can find the general description of the real-time WebSocket Stream here. This page focuses on the stock stream.

URL
The URL for the stock stream is


wss://stream.data.alpaca.markets/{version}/{feed}
Sandbox URL:


wss://stream.data.sandbox.alpaca.markets/{version}/{feed}
Substitute {version}/{feed} to one of the followings:

v2/sip is the SIP (Securities Information Processor) feed
v2/iex is the IEX (Investors Exchange) feed
v2/delayed_sip is a 15-minute delayed SIP feed
v1beta1/boats is the BOATS (Blue Ocean ATS) feed
v1beta1/overnight is the derived Alpaca overnight feed
These feeds are described here.

Any attempt to access a data feed not available for your subscription will result in an error during authentication.

Bars
There are three separate channels where you can stream trade aggregates (bars).

Minute Bars (bars)
Minute bars are emitted right after each minute mark. They contain the trades from the previous minute. Trades from pre-market and aftermarket are also aggregated and sent out on the bars channel.

Note: Understanding which trades are excluded from minute bars is crucial for accurate data analysis. For more detailed information on how minute bars are calculated and excluded trades, please refer to this article Stock Minute Bars.

Daily Bars (dailyBars)
Daily bars are emitted right after each minute mark after the market opens. The daily bars contain all trades until the time they were emitted.

Updated Bars (updatedBars)
Updated bars are emitted after each half-minute mark if a “late” trade arrived after the previous minute mark. For example if a trade with a timestamp of 16:49:59.998 arrived right after 16:50:00, just after 16:50:30 an updated bar with t set to 16:49:00 will be sent containing that trade, possibly updating the previous bar’s closing price and volume.

Order imbalances
Order imbalance is a situation resulting from an excess of buy or sell orders for a specific security on a trading exchange, making it impossible to match the orders of buyers and sellers. Order imbalance messages are typically sent during limit-up and limit-down trading halts. You have to subscribe to these messages using the imbalances JSON key:
